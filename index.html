            Typographic Systems
            <p>Presented here is my finalized typographic systems project. Over the course of this project, I researched the eight distinct typographic systems, conducting research to understand the characteristics of these systems and have created a layout using each of them. These can be found below. Hover for more information about each system.</p>

                    <h1>Axial</h1>
                    <p>The axial typographic system is characterised by two elements positioned on either side of a single axis, typically at an angle. When done at an angle, this arrangement creates a form that resembles a branch of a tree, with typography that mimics leaves positioned perpendicular to the primary type (the branch). I have created a typographic composition employing the axial system. To achieve this, I have positioned the most important text at an upward angle, serving as the main title, and then included the important body and subtext perpendicular to the original axis.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Radial</h1>
                    <p>The radial typographic system revolves around a central point, with text that emanates outward, similar to the teeth of a gear. In my execution of this typographic system, I have used fundamental shapes to establish a circular focal point from which all the text extends outward. This not only adds visual interest but also contributes to improved readability.</p>

            <div class="image-box">

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Dilatational</h1>
                    <p>The dilatational typographic system shares similarities with the radial system as it uses a central point. However, compared to radial, dilatational is a more circular system where text follows a curve, usually forming a circle or an arc, as opposed to projecting outwards like a ray. Notably, dilatational may also use multiple focus points, whereas radial usually uses just one. I have used this system by creating arcs and circles of text around three different focal points, each of them intertwining to show the fluid-like nature of the system. I have also used these three separate elements to arrange the text into a natural hierarchy (titles, body, and essential information).</p>

                    <h1>Random</h1>
                    <p>The random typographic system is characterised by its randomness. This is the most abstract of all the typographic systems, as there are no rules or purpose for how type is placed or displayed. In my application of this system, I played with size, colour, font, style, and positioning. I have also used methods that are generally considered bad for readability; however, in this instance, they work to push the randomness of the system. For example, I have implemented repeating text, created creatively shaped paragraphs, and overlapped text.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Grid</h1>
                    <p>The grid typographic system uses text that sits in different segments of an aligned grid. This grid can be in any arrangement, and different-size text or visual elements can be used, assuming they fit within a single grid section or expand across multiple grid sections. This system usually results in a very minimalist layout and style. I have used the grid system slightly differently from the traditional way you would see it used in a magazine or article and have used a variety of font sizes, so smaller but longer pieces of text interlock and align with the main title and other larger elements.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Modular</h1>
                    <p>The modular typographic system is text that is in a repeated style or structure, for example, text in repeating shapes or patterns. Modular layouts share many similarities with the grid system, as most typography using the grid system could be considered modular too. This is especially true when the modular elements are square and aligned in a grid. However, for the system to be considered modular, the repeated elements do not have to align or be placed in any specific layout. In my demonstration of this system, I placed my text in repeating squares but positioned them randomly to show the differences to the grid typographic system.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Transitional</h1>
                    <p>The transitional typographic system uses text following an abstract curve or wave-like shape and is structured in layers. Similar to how the dilatational system works, the text follows the path of a curve; however, in this system, it is not circular and is shaped to imitate a flow, with each next line of text placed beneath following the same or similar motion. I have used this system by creating random paths all moving in a similar direction and having a different line of text run across each of them.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Bilateral</h1>
                    <p>The bilateral typographic system is considered to be the simplest of all the typographic systems, as it simply means that all the text is centred, which creates a symmetrical style. This system is seen in lots of places and has one of the highest levels of readability when compared to the other systems due to its simple structure. I have created a composition using this method and tried to create variety by styling and positioning text based on its hierarchy and importance.</p>
