            <h1>WELCOME</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my completed design fundamentals website project. This website is a portfolio of all my completed work for the first assessment of the graphic and web design studio module. I have completed the three distinct projects set in the brief as well as the accompanying reflective essay, and seamlessly incorporated them into this HTML and CSS website which uses flexbox for optimal scaling. The projects below delve into three fundamental areas: HTML/CSS, Graphic Design, and Typography.</p>

                Coding Worksheets
                <p>In this assignment, I was provided with 5 coding worksheets that would teach me the basics of HTML and CSS. Displayed here are the completed worksheets which have given me the necessary skills to create this final website for the project. You can view each of these completed worksheets as a final live site below and access my GitHub repositories page where the history of progress of each worksheet can be seen.</p>

                    <p>By completing this first worksheet I got to understand how GitHub functions and how to use GitHub desktop in conjunction with Visual Studio Code to have version control for my work. This has the added benefit of being a backup of my work in the cloud in case anything was to happen to the files on my local machine. I found this concept quite simple as it is explained well throughout the worksheet. As part of the worksheet, I also had to create a super simple HTML page and then practice committing and pushing to GitHub. This was my first introduction to HTML, however I found this quite easy as the worksheet only instructed to use a couple of basic HTML tags and some simple body text, just as a practice.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Throughout the next two worksheets I learnt a lot. From worksheet 2 I started to learn the basics of how HTML is structured and a load of new HTML tags which I can use to add different elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. In worksheet 3 I started using CSS to style the basic HTML and make it look more like a real website. I first learnt how to create a CSS file and link it to my HTML file; this would allow me to start styling. I learnt lots of CSS which let me style text, backgrounds, and sections of my page. I also learnt how to add images and create class selectors alongside the CSS that corresponds with them. Overall, I found these worksheets much harder than the first one, however, I now understand these basic of HTML and CSS which will be crucial when it come to creating my final site.</p>

                    <p>In the final two worksheets, I learnt the basics of flexbox, how to embed videos and audio, and how to use anchors. Flexbox at first seemed extremely complicated but after playing around with it while completing the worksheet, I started to figure it out. The box model really helped to make sense of how flexbox and HTML in general functions. The image and audio integration was quite similar to embedding images so this was quite simple. I also learnt to use anchors which was crucial as I know I want to use these in my final website. Worksheet five also taught me how to add multiple pages and buttons as well as how to import fonts from the likes of google and adobe fonts which are all necessities for a modern webpage. Overall, I found these worksheets to be relatively easy once I wrapped my head around flexbox and the box model.</p>

            Typographic Systems
            <p>Presented here is my finalized typographic systems project. Over the course of this project, I researched the eight distinct typographic systems, conducting research to understand the characteristics of these systems and have created a layout using each of them. These can be found below. Hover for more information about each system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-grid">
            <div class="image-box">

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Axial</h1>
                    <p>The axial typographic system is characterised by two elements positioned on either side of a single axis, typically at an angle. When done at an angle, this arrangement creates a form that resembles a branch of a tree, with typography that mimics leaves positioned perpendicular to the primary type (the branch). I have created a typographic composition employing the axial system. To achieve this, I have positioned the most important text at an upward angle, serving as the main title, and then included the important body and subtext perpendicular to the original axis.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="Images/radial.jpg">
                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Radial</h1>
                    <p>The radial typographic system revolves around a central point, with text that emanates outward, similar to the teeth of a gear. In my execution of this typographic system, I have used fundamental shapes to establish a circular focal point from which all the text extends outward. This not only adds visual interest but also contributes to improved readability.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="Images/dilatational.jpg">
                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Dilatational</h1>
                    <p>The dilatational typographic system shares similarities with the radial system as it uses a central point. However, compared to radial, dilatational is a more circular system where text follows a curve, usually forming a circle or an arc, as opposed to projecting outwards like a ray. Notably, dilatational may also use multiple focus points, whereas radial usually uses just one. I have used this system by creating arcs and circles of text around three different focal points, each of them intertwining to show the fluid-like nature of the system. I have also used these three separate elements to arrange the text into a natural hierarchy (titles, body, and essential information).</p>

            <div class="image-box">

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Random</h1>
                    <p>The random typographic system is characterised by its randomness. This is the most abstract of all the typographic systems, as there are no rules or purpose for how type is placed or displayed. In my application of this system, I played with size, colour, font, style, and positioning. I have also used methods that are generally considered bad for readability; however, in this instance, they work to push the randomness of the system. For example, I have implemented repeating text, created creatively shaped paragraphs, and overlapped text.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Grid</h1>
                    <p>The grid typographic system uses text that sits in different segments of an aligned grid. This grid can be in any arrangement, and different-size text or visual elements can be used, assuming they fit within a single grid section or expand across multiple grid sections. This system usually results in a very minimalist layout and style. I have used the grid system slightly differently from the traditional way you would see it used in a magazine or article and have used a variety of font sizes, so smaller but longer pieces of text interlock and align with the main title and other larger elements.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Modular</h1>
                    <p>The modular typographic system is text that is in a repeated style or structure, for example, text in repeating shapes or patterns. Modular layouts share many similarities with the grid system, as most typography using the grid system could be considered modular too. This is especially true when the modular elements are square and aligned in a grid. However, for the system to be considered modular, the repeated elements do not have to align or be placed in any specific layout. In my demonstration of this system, I placed my text in repeating squares but positioned them randomly to show the differences to the grid typographic system.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Transitional</h1>
                    <p>The transitional typographic system uses text following an abstract curve or wave-like shape and is structured in layers. Similar to how the dilatational system works, the text follows the path of a curve; however, in this system, it is not circular and is shaped to imitate a flow, with each next line of text placed beneath following the same or similar motion. I have used this system by creating random paths all moving in a similar direction and having a different line of text run across each of them.</p>

                <div class="image-text">
                    <h1>Bilateral</h1>
                    <p>The bilateral typographic system is considered to be the simplest of all the typographic systems, as it simply means that all the text is centred, which creates a symmetrical style. This system is seen in lots of places and has one of the highest levels of readability when compared to the other systems due to its simple structure. I have created a composition using this method and tried to create variety by styling and positioning text based on its hierarchy and importance.</p>

                CARP
                <p>(Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity)</p>
                <p>Displayed here are my three initial, and final design for the CARP task in this project. For each of these designs I tried to incorporate all the principles of CARP (Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity) and try out multiple styles to find what worked the best, stylistically, with the content that was to be used from the task brief. Below you will discover my processes to create each poster and how I used the CARP principles to create an effective final piece.</p>

                    <h1>First Design</h1>
                    <p>This is my first design for the CARP (Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity) task. In this first design I wanted to go for a halftone/comic look that mimics themes from 90s skate culture design. I started this piece by curating a simple two-tone colour palette that I felt gave a 90s/vintage feel and combatted gender stereotypes, instead of going for pink or colours that are usually associated with the female gender I used a combination of blue and orange. To create the hand drawn look, I used the threshold adjustment in photoshop and then imported the images into InDesign for my main composition.</p>
                    <p>My main use of the CARP principles was certainly contrast as blue and orange are complementary colours and create great visual contrast that catches the eye. I also utilised alignment to allow the key information to easily be digested at a quick glance. There are also elements of repetition and proximity for example the repetitive nature of the way the dates are structured and the proximity of the oval elements that are used as a divider of different text elements. I also experimented with a range of typefaces meshing both modern and playful fonts together. To create the main “Girls Skate Clinic” title I tried out the inflate tool within illustrator that allowed me to create a 3D title and then used the same threshold tool I used for the images to create a interesting stencil look. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="poster-obj">
                    <img src="Images/Design2.jpg" alt="">
                    <h1>Second Design</h1>
                    <p>For my second design I took inspiration from a full page spread you may find in fashion or lifestyle magazines. I’ve used a large image taking up the majority of the page and then contrasted this against the small text section that contains all the important information. I also decided to only use black and white for this piece to focus on the contrast, however, I did incorporate a hint of colour (the website URL) to draw the eye to a specific piece of information.</p>
                    <p>The typeface I used for this piece was also carefully selected, I decided to go with Helvetica as it is one of the most used typefaces in design and I felt that it worked well with the editorial/magazine style of the poster as it is commonly used in this type of design. You can also see my use of alignment in this poster where the focus is centred and then all the crucial text is placed either to the left or right of the page. Repetition is also present, with the one coloured element (the URL) being repeated three times to pop. While converting the main image to black and white in photoshop I also decided to add some texture using a scan overlay and grain through the camera raw filter, this gives the image a 35mm photographic film look, commonly associated with skating in the 90s. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="poster-obj">
                    <img src="Images/Design3.jpg" alt="">
                    <h1>Third Design</h1>
                    <p>In my third and final design I decided to take inspiration from my two previous compositions but focus on readability and simple eye-catching visual content. I started off by using repletion to create a simple black background with the word skate repeated multiple times, in a playful font, down the page in purple to create contrast. I then found an image of a girl with a skateboard on a free stock photo website and used the same technique used in my first design, the threshold tool in photoshop, to create a black and white, high contrast style. In this instance I had to use multiple different threshold values and mask to keep definition in the key areas, the hair, eyes, and face. I placed this image over the background in the centre of the composition blocking out parts of the background and subsequently creating the illusion of depth.</p>
                    <p>After creating the main bulk of this composition, I used the shape tools to cut out sections over the background text and use them as text boxes. This helped the text stand out from the rest of the composition and helped readability. I used colour in these shapes also to help highlight crucial pieces of information, in this case, the price and availability. Again, I played with different fonts and settled on two playful fonts for the title and background elements and Helvetica for the key information, these choices helped create a good hierarchy of importance between the pieces of text.</p>

            <h1>Reflection Essay</h1>
            <p>Throughout the Design Fundamentals Website Project I faced many challenges, but through perseverance, I overcame these challenges and I have learnt a lot through completing each of the tasks set as deliverables for this project. Having a background in graphic design both educationally and professionally I found the CARP and Typography tasks simpler than the web design tasks but I have learnt a lot about design principles and typographic design of which I previously was unaware. Regarding the coding worksheets and the development of my final website however, I was much less educated and allocated a lot of my time to learning and understanding the behaviour of HTML and CSS. I am confident that I now have a good, albeit basic, understanding of web design which will help me in future web design related projects and eventually allow me to use these skills in real world applications.</p>
            <p>While designing my final website that houses the rest of the work from this project, I wanted to create a modern look and present all my work on one page that can be navigated using anchor links rather than separate pages for each task. In a way this simplified the design process, but as stated in the brief I needed to use flexbox to make the site work on a variety of devices, browsers and screen sizes. This meant a lot of CSS was needed in order for everything to be displayed and function as I intended on all devices, despite this complicated things as it meant I had to make more use of flexbox than I would’ve potentially needed to if I had a multi-page site. After much frustration with elements on the page not acting as I wanted, I finally have achieved the look I set out to create and have the page functioning correctly on a multitude of devices. Thanks to this process I now properly understood how flexbox and CSS work, and how HTML pages are structured.</p>
            <p>Having used Adobe Photoshop for over 5 years I have become extremely comfortable with the software and when we were told we had to use Adobe Illustrator and InDesign to complete the graphic design and typography tasks I was concerned as I had truly little experience with these programs. I still have much to learn about both tools but due to these tasks I now have a basic understanding of how they function and their use cases. I found Illustrator to be the easier of the two due to its similarities with Photoshop but I found InDesign to be quite restrictive and didn’t have all the features I needed to reach my vision in the CARP task. However, using it alongside Photoshop and Illustrator I managed to complete both tasks to a high-enough standard that I am pleased with the results.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this project has been greatly beneficial to improving my existing skillset and providing me with entirely new ones. I am happy with the outcomes of each of the tasks but hope to learn more in the future to flesh out my skills and allow me to be more creative and experimental with upcoming projects.</p>
